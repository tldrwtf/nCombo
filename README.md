Co-Pilot Written README


This Python script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) tool named nCombo using the `tkinter` library. The tool is designed for manipulating text files, offering functionalities like merging, deduplicating, sorting, filtering, splitting, and appending content of files. It provides a user-friendly way to perform these operations without needing to write custom scripts or use command-line tools.

### GUI Components and Layout
The GUI is structured around a main window (`root`) with various widgets arranged in a grid layout inside a main frame (`main_frame`). These widgets include labels (`input_label`, `output_label`), text areas ([`input_text`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CUsers%5C%5Cmfwba%5C%5CDesktop%5C%5CComboTool%20GUI%20nCombo.py%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fmfwba%2FDesktop%2FComboTool%20GUI%20nCombo.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A178%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "c:\Users\mfwba\Desktop\ComboTool GUI nCombo.py"), [`output_text`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CUsers%5C%5Cmfwba%5C%5CDesktop%5C%5CComboTool%20GUI%20nCombo.py%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fmfwba%2FDesktop%2FComboTool%20GUI%20nCombo.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A182%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "c:\Users\mfwba\Desktop\ComboTool GUI nCombo.py")) for displaying input and output, a list box ([`file_listbox`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CUsers%5C%5Cmfwba%5C%5CDesktop%5C%5CComboTool%20GUI%20nCombo.py%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fmfwba%2FDesktop%2FComboTool%20GUI%20nCombo.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A195%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "c:\Users\mfwba\Desktop\ComboTool GUI nCombo.py")) for managing files, and several buttons (`paste_button`, `upload_button`, `merge_button`, etc.) that trigger different functionalities. The layout is designed to be intuitive, with input and output areas clearly labeled and operations logically grouped.

### Core Functionalities
- **File Operations**: Users can upload files, and their contents are stored in a dictionary ([`file_contents`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CUsers%5C%5Cmfwba%5C%5CDesktop%5C%5CComboTool%20GUI%20nCombo.py%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fmfwba%2FDesktop%2FComboTool%20GUI%20nCombo.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A200%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "c:\Users\mfwba\Desktop\ComboTool GUI nCombo.py")). The tool allows for displaying, merging, removing duplicates from, sorting, and appending file contents. It also supports splitting files based on a specified number of lines.
- **Filtering**: Two types of filtering are supported: plaintext and regex. Users can input a pattern, and the tool will filter lines in the input text area that match this pattern.
- **Clipboard Interaction**: The tool can paste content from the clipboard into the input text area, facilitating easy data transfer.
- **Memory Usage Monitoring**: A background thread monitors and displays the system's memory usage, providing feedback on the tool's impact on system resources.

### Threading and Performance
For operations that could potentially take a long time, such as splitting large files, the script utilizes Python's `threading` module to prevent the GUI from becoming unresponsive. These operations are executed in separate threads, allowing the main GUI thread to remain responsive to user input.

### User Feedback
Throughout the script, feedback is provided to the user through message boxes that display errors or confirmations, enhancing the user experience by making the tool more interactive and informative.

### Conclusion
Overall, this script demonstrates a comprehensive application of the `tkinter` library to create a practical and user-friendly tool for text file manipulation. It showcases how Python can be used to build applications that simplify complex tasks through a graphical interface.
